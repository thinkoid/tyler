Tyler
=====

Tyler is derivative work.

Its parent is dwm which I used as a template, debugging reference and learning
tutorial. I stripped out all that I did not find essential to my workflow in
dwm. Although all code has been re-written (c89) it is still conceptually
identical to dwm. The only notable difference is the mechanism of hiding windows
-- dwm moves them outside screen boundaries while tyler unmaps them.
